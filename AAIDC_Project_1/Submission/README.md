Assistant: **The Real World Dilemma**
=========================

According to the publication, the real world dilemma is that humans may retreat into perfect, artificial dream worlds and lose their connection to reality if they do not enjoy or value the problems in the real world.

**Key Points**
---------------

* Humans may be attracted to perfect, artificial environments that are free from flaws and difficulties.
* This can lead to a disconnection from reality and a loss of engagement with real-world problems.
* The ability to enjoy and engage with the imperfections of reality becomes a crucial survival skill.
